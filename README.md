# Boyce - Machine Learning - Two-Day Code Project
NOTE: I did all of this code in two days, so there is much room for improvement.  Just wanted to prove that I could still do it.

## Concept
I was attempting to create a PCA, LDA, and EM_GMM utility files that could be used on any input set of data.

## Code
You will find all of the PCA, LDA, and EM_GMM utility files as well as a preProcessing and plotting method in /Utilities.

You will find the datasets (Iris and Cryo) in /Datasets/<Dataset_name/Data.  NOTE: Both of these datasets were obtained via: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html

You will find the code that I used in order to test the Datasets against the PCA, LDA, and EM_GMM algorithms in /Datasets/<Dataset_name>/Code

## Pictures
You will find a "proof_of_concept" for EM_GMM in the /Utilities/EM_GMM_Plots folder.
You will find all other pictures in /Datasets/<Dataset_name>/Plots.

NOTE: In the pictures labeled "mean_movement", I attempt to show the movement of the mean of a Gaussian by plotting the initial mean location with a "X", then concurrent locations with a ".", and the final location with a "*".
